## User Manual

Welcome to LNET

This user manual provides guidance on the proper use of the LNET application.
Before proceeding, please ensure that the installation process has been fully completed.

If the application is ready to be used, carefully follow the steps outlined below to initialize 
and operate the system effectively.

2. Launch LabVIEW 2022 manually.
3. Open the OpenSPM Project located in the C module (not the D module).
4. Run `menu.vi`.
5. From within `menu.vi`, open both the LV Bridge and Z Scan modules.
